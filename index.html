<main>
    <p>Thank you for choosing our Image Generator App ("the App"). The App helps users create and generate images using AI-powered 
    image generation, facilitated by third-party AI services. It does not use its own proprietary models; rather, it relies on external services. By 
    downloading, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p><strong>User Identifiers:</strong> When you use the App, we may assign a unique user ID. This ID helps us manage your subscriptions, 
    maintain service continuity, and understand usage patterns without directly linking activities to your real identity.</p>
    <p><strong>Subscription and Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to our premium services (including automatic weekly renewals), 
    we collect information related to your subscription status and purchase history. This may include subscription type, duration, renewal status, 
    transaction identifiers, and payment confirmation records from our subscription service provider, 
    <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Usage Information</h3>
    <p><strong>Analytics Data (Amplitude):</strong> We use <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a>, a third-party analytics service, 
    to understand how you interact with the App. Data includes screens viewed, buttons pressed, and duration of feature usage. We use this 
    information solely to improve the App's functionality, design, and performance.</p>

    <p><strong>Prompt and Image Generation:</strong> When you use the App to generate images, your text prompts, customization settings, and 
    related generation parameters are processed through AI models provided by third-party services including:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability.ai</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a></li>
    </ul>
    These services are facilitated through <a href="https://www.aiproxy.com/">AiProxy</a>.<br>
    <em>Text Prompt Handling:</em> Your text prompts and generation parameters are transmitted securely to the external services for processing.<br>
    <em>Storage of Prompts and Generated Images:</em> We may temporarily store your prompts and generated images to provide the service, improve functionality, 
    and maintain your generation history within the app. Your prompt library is stored locally on your device.<br>
    <em>Reference Images:</em> If you upload reference images to guide the generation process, these images are transmitted to the AI services 
    but are not permanently stored on our servers.</p>

    <h3>1.3 User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p><strong>Saved Prompts:</strong> The App allows you to save and manage your prompt library for future use. These are stored locally on your device and are accessible through the Prompt Library feature.</p>
    <p><strong>Generated Images:</strong> Images created using the App are primarily stored on your device. You may choose to save, share, or export these images according to your preferences.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Device and Technical Information</h3>
    <p><strong>Device Data:</strong> We may collect device model, operating system version, language settings, and unique identifiers.</p>
    <p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers may automatically record certain information ("Log Data") such as IP addresses, App version, 
    request times/dates, and general usage patterns.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide and Improve the App:</strong> Understand usage patterns to enhance features, reliability, and user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Process Subscriptions and Purchases:</strong> Manage payment verification, subscription renewals, and account authentication via RevenueCat.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> Use Amplitude data to guide improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Research and Development:</strong> Refine the image generation process. Any temporarily stored data is anonymized or de-identified.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Assist with inquiries, troubleshoot problems, and provide technical support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The primary purpose of using your data is to improve the App's functionality and enhance the user experience.</p>

    <h2>3. AI Image Generation, Quality, and Disclaimers</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Third-Party AI Services</h3>
    <p>The App uses multiple AI models and services from Stability.ai, Replicate, OpenRouter, and other providers via AiProxy to generate images. 
    The App itself does not have its own models; it only provides an interface for these external services.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Quality Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The generated images may vary in quality, consistency, and accuracy. They are produced by advanced machine learning 
    models but are not guaranteed to meet specific aesthetic standards or precisely match your prompts. The results are for creative and 
    informational purposes only and should not be considered professional design or artwork.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Content Policies</h3>
    <p>The App implements content moderation in accordance with our providers' content policies. Certain types of prompts or requests may be
    automatically filtered or rejected. We do not permit the generation of harmful, explicit, illegal, or otherwise prohibited content as
    defined by our third-party providers' terms of service.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that the generated images are provided "as is" and "as available." You should not rely on 
    the App for mission-critical or commercial purposes without independent verification. As an individual developer, I am not liable for any 
    issues, inaccuracies, or outcomes related to these results.</p>

    <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use third-party providers for payment processing (RevenueCat), analytics (Amplitude), and AI processing (Stability.ai, Replicate, 
    OpenRouter, AiProxy). They only access your information as needed and must not use it for other purposes.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your information if required by law or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal 
    obligations, protect our rights, investigate wrongdoing, or ensure the safety of users or the public.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. 
    We will provide notice before it becomes subject to a different policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described or as required by law. Your prompts, generated images, and reference images are stored on your device and in Apple CloudKit for synchronization purposes, not on our servers. We do not have control over the retention of data stored in Apple CloudKit. Any data that may be temporarily processed through our systems is not permanently stored and is used only to facilitate the image generation process. Analytics data collected is anonymized and kept only for short durations to improve services.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of 
    transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Controls</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Access and Correction</h3>

    <h3>6.2 Opt-Out of Analytics</h3>
    <p>You can limit or disable certain analytics features via your device's or the App's settings.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Subscription Management</h3>
    <p>Manage or cancel subscriptions anytime through your device's account settings or the app store. Uninstalling the App does not 
    automatically cancel your subscription.</p>

    <h3>6.4 Prompt and Image Management</h3>
    <p>You can manage, delete, or modify your saved prompts through the Prompt Library feature within the App. Generated images can be managed through your device's native photo management system or within the App's gallery. Data synchronized through Apple CloudKit can be managed according to Apple's CloudKit data management policies and through your iCloud settings. Deleting content from one device will synchronize deletion across your connected devices.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
    from minors under 18. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be transferred to servers outside your jurisdiction. In such cases, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to external sites or services not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these external entities. 
    We recommend reviewing their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. We will notify you by posting the new policy 
    in the App or on our website. Continued use of the App after changes signifies acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
